## About Me

I’m a dedicated Software Test Engineer with a background in Mechatronics Engineering and a strong passion for building reliable and maintainable test systems.

After graduating in 2019, I co-founded an e-commerce startup, where I identified the need for software testing and took full responsibility for the testing process. I started with manual test cases and bug reporting, and later built a UI automation framework using Java and Selenium, focusing on critical flows like payment and cross-browser compatibility.

In my second role at a B2B/B2C e-commerce business, I led both manual and automated test efforts. I implemented a hybrid testing strategy combining Selenium (for UI and responsive design testing) and REST-assured (for API setup and preconditions). I created modular, reusable automation scripts following the Page Object Model and integrated them into Jenkins pipelines to ensure continuous feedback and test reliability.

I pay close attention to user experience in responsive design testing—simulating different screen sizes, verifying element behavior, and ensuring accessibility across devices. My approach includes strong bug tracking/reporting practices using tools like Trello and Jira.

I actively pursue growth through certifications (ISTQB), hands-on projects, and bootcamps. I’m currently seeking opportunities where I can apply my testing knowledge and contribute to scalable and efficient quality assurance solutions.
