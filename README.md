## About Me

I am a passionate Software Test Engineer with a background in Mechatronics Engineering. After graduating in 2019, I co-founded an e-commerce startup where I developed and managed the entire testing process—from creating manual test scenarios and reporting bugs to automating UI and API tests using Java, Selenium, and Rest Assured. I later expanded my experience by working on both B2B and B2C e-commerce platforms, implementing responsive design tests and integrating automated test frameworks with CI/CD tools like Jenkins.

I continuously upgrade my skills through certifications and specialized courses, and I’m eager to contribute my expertise in test automation and quality assurance to new, dynamic projects.
